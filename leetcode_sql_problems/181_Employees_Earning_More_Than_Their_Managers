## 📝 Problem

Table: `Employee`

| Column    | Type    |
|-----------|---------|
| id        | int     |
| name      | varchar |
| salary    | int     |
| managerId | int     |

Each employee may have a manager, and the manager is also in the same table
(`managerId` references `id`).

Write a SQL query to report the names of employees who earn **more than their managers**.

Return the result table with the column:

| Column   |
|----------|
| Employee |

---

## ✅ Solution (Self-Join)

```sql
SELECT e1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e1
JOIN Employee e2
  ON e1.managerId = e2.id
WHERE e1.salary > e2.salary;
